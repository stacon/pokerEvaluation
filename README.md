# pokerEvaluation

Poker Evaluation is a simple NodeJS program made to evaluate poker hands.
In this particular project I've set 4 goals:
  - Combine functional/OOP concepts with the best possible ways.
  - Write an eloquent code making index.js the only file needed to understand the program's logic.
  - Evaluate poker hand types with the most efficient way I can think of at the moment
  - Learn through the progress

This program will scale up to a game of poker in the near future..

## Installation notes
- Make sure you have node.js
- npm i
- spend 3 minutes to understand how the script works by reading the index.js file (and if you failed to understand, that's on me)
- node ./index.js

(use both methods and give me feedback, about which one you liked most)

Thanks,
Constantine
